## How to Add Library Files to Proteus

1. **Locate the Files:**
   - You will typically have two types of files for each library: `.LIB` and `.IDX`, and sometimes `.HEX` or `.DLL`.
   - Also, there may be a `MODELS` folder containing required simulation models.

2. **Navigate to Proteus Library Folder:**
   - Go to the installation directory of Proteus (commonly: `C:\ProgramData\Labcenter Electronics\Proteus 8 Professional\LIBRARY`).

3. **Paste the Library Files:**
   - Copy and paste the `.LIB` and `.IDX` files into the `LIBRARY` folder.
   - If a `MODELS` folder is provided, copy its contents into the same directory or within the `MODELS` sub-folder if it exists.

4. **Restart Proteus:**
   - Close and reopen Proteus for the new components to be loaded.

5. **Use the Component Mode:**
   - Open any schematic and select "P" to search for new components using the keywords (e.g., "IR Sensor", "Arduino UNO", etc.)
